/*
Features: title, description, dueDate, createdDate, priority, checklist, notes, localStorage API - *not necessary harder to implement features* (groups, reminders, sorting, subtasks)

Notes:
- separate application logic (creating new todos, setting todos as complete, changing todo priority etc...)
- separate modules from the DOM-related stuff
- localStorage API for Saving
- JSON exchange with localStorage API, no functions

Interface having at least:

    1. View all projects.
    2. View all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedate… perhaps changing color for different priorities).
    3. Expand a single todo to see/edit its details, notes maybe.
    4. Delete a todo.

Plan to Implement it:

1. default project (group?) in which todo's upon loading the website, and upon creation.
2. should be able to create new projects and choose which project (group?) their todos go into
3. 
X. function that saves the projects (and todos) to localStorage every time a new project (or todo) is created, and another function that looks for that data in localStorage on first load.
